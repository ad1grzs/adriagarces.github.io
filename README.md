# Introduction

Welcome! My name is **AdriÃ **, and I am a PhD student in Physics at the *University of Barcelona*, working in the fascinating field of **Active Matter**. My research primarily focuses on systems such as *Active Brownian Particles* and *Non-Reciprocal Interactions*, although I am broadly interested in problems within **Statistical Physics**, both in and out of equilibrium. I also maintain a strong appreciation for mathematics and its foundational role in theoretical physics.

This page serves as a repository of materials I have producedâ€”whether to share potentially useful content with others or simply to document and organise my own work. Feel free to explore, and do not hesitate to contact me if you have questions, comments, or spot any mistakes.

# Introduction
Greetings! I'm AdriÃ , a PhD student from Barcelona pursuing research in the field of Active Matter. I'm knee-deep in topics like Active Brownian Particles and Non-Reciprocal Interactions, even though I find interest in (mostly) anything regarding Statistical Physics, equilibrium or not. I hold deep respect and love for math in general.

In this page, I upload whatever I feel like can be useful for anyone to use or (simply) for myself to keep track of what I do. Feel free to scroll through and explore, and do not hesitate to get in touch with me for any doubt you may have or mistake I may have madeâ€”welcome aboard!
